24
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,360
It's not saying anything there's nothing wrong with a little quiet. I know why they call him baby, right?

25
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Wait, not his first words

For God's sake scruff leave the kid alone you can't just be in crime right not without being a little criminal

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,960
Just think that he thinks he's better than us

34
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,040
Once you sit there in his car keep his white shirt clean while the rest of us we roll in the dirt

35
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:06,440
One of these days baby you're gonna get blood on your hands and you're gonna find out that that shit don't wash off in the fucking sink

36
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:14,240
Relax the kid did his job. All right. I ever say that the kid wasn't great at his job. Nah, I think he's a star

37
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,400
What I've asked for him if he wasn't

38
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,920
Got a hint you told him pole either hardest nails or scared shit

39
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:54,160
You think about that baby mommy and daddy are getting in on enough where you get off

The woman came into the bank branch cloud and black business clothing

56
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Oh

57
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280

You are so beautiful

61
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
They grow up so freaking fast, don't they

62
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,320
That is more important than our friendship

63
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,600
That's it working out for you and still the bull stands bloody but unrelenting

64
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,440
Gaston is running out of time. He's had his tries from horseback now. He must try to end this on foot

65
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Retard him in slow. Was he slow?

66
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
No, was he slow?

67
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
No, was he slow?

68
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
No

69
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Retard him in slow. Was he slow?

70
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
No

71
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Retard him in slow. Was he slow?

72
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
No, slow slow slow

73
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Oh

74
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,720
Oh

75
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Oh

76
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I really don't wanna help you live.

77
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
B-A-B-Y, baby.

78
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,600
B-A-B-Y, baby.

79
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Whenever the sun don't shine.

80
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
So, where can I get you this fine morning?

81
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Oh, don't worry if you need a second.

82
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I have all the time in the world.

83
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Are you recording this?

84
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
No, I...

85
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Hello, testing.

86
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What can I get you this fine morning, sir?

87
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh, that's a kid's menu, right?

88
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
So you're just starting your day, or did you just get off?

89
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I don't know if I ever get off. They call I go, you know.

90
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
So what is it you do?

91
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm a driver. Oh, like a chauffeur?

92
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
You drive around important people? I guess I do. Anyone I'd know?

93
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I hope not. Well, aren't you mysterious?

94
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Maybe. Maybe?

95
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
This is the last time you hit the road just for fun.

96
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm jealous. Sometimes all I wanna do is head west on 20 in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have.

97
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Just me, my music, and the road.

98
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
I'd like that, too.

99
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,600
So, you deciding anything yet? You are so beautiful.

100
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You just decided that. Oh, well, thank you.

101
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm sure you don't mean it. I do mean it.

102
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Jonathan? Oh, sorry. You know, this isn't my badge.

103
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I've only just started here. Is it Jonathan?

104
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Yeah, that's a Jonathan. Well, if you have any more questions, just holler.

105
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
B-A-B-Y, baby.

106
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I have a question. What's that song you're singing?

107
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,600
What's that song you're singing?

108
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I don't know.

109
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
I don't know.

110
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Baby, oh baby

111
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I love to call you baby

112
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Baby, oh baby

113
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I love for you to call me baby

114
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
When you squeeze me real tight

115
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
You make wrong things right

116
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,600
And I can't stop loving you

117
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
And I won't stop calling you baby

118
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Baby, oh baby

119
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,600
You look so good to me baby

120
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Oh, there you are.

121
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I've been calling, baby. You have? I have.

122
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,600
My chicken just laid a very big egg. You in?

123
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Am I in? It was a rhetorical question, baby.

124
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,600
You're in. I'll be there.

125
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Music

126
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Music

127
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Meet your new crew. Over here is Eddie No-Nose,

128
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
formerly Eddie the Nose. Well, what happened?

129
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Don't ask me that. That's a No-Nose, No-No, Page One.

130
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
And right here is JD. He put the Asian in Home Invasion. And over there is the one and the only. Bats!

131
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,600
No need for intro, Doc. Everybody from the jungle to the trap. No bass.

132
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,600
She bored, right?

133
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,600
This one, he say listen to the music all the time.

134
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
The drive is supposed to be the eyes and the ears. Not just the eyes.

135
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Why does he listen to music all the time, Doc? It's got mental problems.

136
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm the one got the mental problems in the crew.

137
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Position taken. He's got tinnitus. Tinnitus?

138
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,600
He had an accident when he was a kid. He still got a hum on the drum. Play his music to drown it out.

139
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Yeah, but you're filming.

140
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Hat.

141
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Huh? Your tattoo says hat?

142
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeah. They used to say hate. But then crew's my chances of employment.

143
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,600
They got the year removed. How's that working out for you?

144
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Who doesn't like hats? So, Doc, how many jobs done with the kid?

145
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,600
If you can't take my word for him, then get back in that fucking elevator.

146
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
You never heard of the Spirit of 85?

147
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,600
The Joy Rider? Yeah. The ghost that baited cops

148
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,600
during 130 on 85. Headlights off, brake lights disconnected.

149
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,600
He drove them around at circles on Spaghetti Junction. Left him in the dust every

150
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,600
time. That was our boy there. Wasn't it like ten years ago? Yeah. Well, like I said, that was our boy.

151
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,600
He's been boosting cars since he was old enough to see over the dash. He stole my Mercedes.

152
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Had a lot of merch in it. I watched him do it too. I didn't stop him though, because I was just

153
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,600
blinded by the balls on that kid. Of course, he didn't know who I was or the worth of

154
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
the junk in the trunk once he dumped it. But once I tracked him down, I made sure to tell

155
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,600
him who I was, what I was capable of, and how much he owed me.

156
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Since he's been paying me back, he's also shown me what he's capable of. Wow.

157
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I just drew a whole goddamn map and chalk while we've been standing here squawking.

158
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
That's pretty fucking impressive, right? Shop! Let's talk it!

159
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Baby, you with us?

160
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Let's talk it over.

161
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,600
What up?

162
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,600
I got a question, Doc.

163
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Why would I believe phones over here to goddamn word you're saying? You lay down in your whole play.

164
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,600
He ain't even listening. Baby?

165
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,600
The target is an armored truck at perimeter trust in Dunwoody, 10 a.m. sharp. We have the details

166
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,600
of the route because someone at the depot has a nasal problem. The bank itself is right

167
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,600
near the Buford Highway, so we should be able to hit the ramp within 60 seconds again now. We also have

168
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
a diversion crew. They're going to blow up a bread truck a ways away, keep the fuzz busy.

169
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,600
The dress code is the Michael Myers Halloween mask, but don't all buy your mask at the same time.

170
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
It looks suspicious. The switch car is ready, but you want me to hit the long

171
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,600
stay parking structure at Heartsfield Jackson to get a high speed vehicle that stays colder longer.

172
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Boost the commuter car, family car, something that blends in well with morning traffic.

173
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Something on the heavy side in case we need to ram the cops off the road.

174
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,600
We need to escalate, Yukon, Avalanche, whatever. We need to be ready for an 830 start.

175
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,600
In the a.m. Questions?

176
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Well, ain't y'all cute? That's my baby.

177
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Fuck your baby.

178
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,600
What's in there is ours.

179
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
It belongs to us.

180
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
They took our money, our hard-earned paper.

181
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,600
They snuck in when we were asleep last night and took the parents off the chair and emptied our

182
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,600
wards. They got what's rightfully ours.

183
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Let's go get it back. What's rightfully ours.

184
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
What the fuck is this, man?

185
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Austin Powers.

186
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Doc said Michael Myers. This is Mike Myers. It should be the Halloween mask.

187
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,600
This is a Halloween mask. No, the killer dude from Halloween.

188
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,600
All you mean, Jason? No!

189
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Let's go. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta start the song over.

190
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,600
What the fuck?

191
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Okay, go.

192
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Let's go.

193
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,600
We out. Let's go.

194
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Let's go.

195
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Go.

196
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Come on, get him.

197
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,600
What the fuck? We got a hero.

198
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Get him.

199
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Get him.

200
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Do your job, baby. Let's go.

201
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Shit.

202
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Watch out. Watch out.

203
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Watch out.

204
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Watch out.

205
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Get him.

206
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Yeah!

207
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,600
That's how you do it, baby.

208
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Come on.

209
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Yeah.

210
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Come on.

211
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,600
What the fuck? Soldier boy.

212
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,600
He ain't giving up, huh?

213
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Come on, Soldier boy.

214
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Shit! No, no, no, no, no, no!

215
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
No!

216
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Got your ass now.

217
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Get him.

218
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Get him.

219
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Get him.

220
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Hey, damn that, G.I. Joe mother fucking dead right?

221
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Got him.

222
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,600
New ride, let's go.

223
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Come on boys, let's rock. Move, move, move, move.

224
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Huh, sweetheart? Oh my god.

225
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Get out the car! I don't have a child!

226
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I got one too. Get the fuck out.

227
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Come on. Get in.

228
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Bring your sorry ass home.

229
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Get your dead real ass over here.

230
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Come on, let's go.

231
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Come on, let's rock.

232
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Let's go.

233
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Oh shit. No.

234
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Fuck!

235
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,600
I left my shotgun behind. What? I left my shotgun behind.

236
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Not groovy, J.D. Not groovy at all.

237
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Come on, come on, come on.

238
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Get out.

239
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Get out!

240
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Get out!

241
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,600
All units be on the lookout for a red, Saturn,

242
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,600
aura, license plate, and number.

243
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,860
and try to fight him up.

244
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,700
This is JD over there and that's Jamie's the idiot.

245
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,160
Tew Brach boys, though.

246
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,860
Saw that associate fight.

247
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Come on, man.

248
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
You can tell me.

249
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
No.

250
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
You're a good driver.

251
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
You're a bad liar, though.

252
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,860
In this business, the moment you catch feelings,

253
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
there's a moment you catch a bullet.

254
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Now pick up your purse and go get the coffee.

255
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
Come on, everybody!

256
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Come on, everybody!

257
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Come on, man.

258
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Come on, man.

259
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
You can tell me.

260
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
Come on, everybody!

261
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Come on, everybody!

262
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Hey!

263
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Hey!

264
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
All right.

265
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Get it.

266
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Get it.

267
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Get it.

268
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
Get it.

269
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
You move to the left.

270
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
Get it.

271
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Move to the right.

272
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
Got a damn time.

273
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
Got a damn time.

274
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Get it.

275
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Oh, you looking for JD?

276
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
International man of mystery?

277
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Because he's long gone, baby.

278
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Let's put it there.

279
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
We'll drink.

280
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
So, this is it.

281
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
I'm a man of my word.

282
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,860
And you're all straight, baby.

283
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
That's it?

284
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Sure is.

285
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
You're all paid up.

286
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
Cost for celebration.

287
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Yeah, sure is.

288
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,860
Oh, yeah, well, before you go completely crazy.

289
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
You need to sunset that ride.

290
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Drive safe, baby.

291
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
I'm going to get out of here.

292
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
I'm going to get out of here.

293
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
I'm going to get out of here.

294
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm going to get out of here.

295
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
I'm going to get out of here.

296
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
I'm going to get out of here.

297
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
I'm going to get out of here.

298
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
I'm going to get out of here.

299
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
I'm going to get out of here.

300
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
I'm going to get out of here.

301
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
I'm going to get out of here.

302
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
I'm going to get out of here.

303
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
I'm going to get out of here.

304
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
I'm going to get out of here.

305
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I'm going to get out of here.

306
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
I'm going to get out of here.

307
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
I'm going to get out of here.

308
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
I'm going to get out of here.

309
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
I'm going to get out of here.

310
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I'm going to get out of here.

311
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm going to get out of here.

312
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I'm going to get out of here.

I'm going to get out of here.

314
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I'm going to get out of here.

315
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm going to get out of here.

316
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
I'm going to get out of here.

317
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
I'm going to get out of here.

318
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
I'm going to get out of here.

319
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
I'm going to get out of here.

320
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

321
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

322
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

323
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,860
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

324
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can.

325
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can.

326
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,860
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

327
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

328
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

329
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

330
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

331
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

332
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

333
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

334
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

335
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
You see your big stone and I bow.

336
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,860
I'm easy like Sunday morning.

337
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
You're back!

338
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
I sure am.

339
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
Then you sir are going to be my very last customer

340
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
because I am walking out that door

341
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Can I come with you?

342
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
You don't have work or nothing?

343
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Uh, I don't.

344
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
I, um, don't move work.

345
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
Wow, you seem real happy about that.

346
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Yeah, sure am.

347
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
I don't blame you.

348
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Well, you're welcome to come with,

349
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
but I don't know how excited you're going to find the laundromat.

350
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
I gotta run some errands.

351
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Oh.

352
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
But think about what you want, and I will stick around just for you.

353
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Coffee?

354
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Please. Yeah, cream of sugar.

355
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
So, how are you two getting along?

356
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
Oh, good.

357
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
He's sweet, isn't he?

358
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,860
That kid?

359
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
He's been coming here since before me.

360
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,860
I think maybe his mom used to work here.

361
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Huh.

362
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
Now what you want?

363
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
Your name?

364
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
Well, you can get that for free.

365
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
It's Debbie.

366
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Deborah.

367
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
What song?

368
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
The Beck one? Yeah.

369
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
Bucks Up Time, D-E-B-O-R-A, and I think that's just D-E-B-R-A.

370
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I don't know that one.

371
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Oh, it goes, um...

372
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
I bet you, Jaycee Penny,

373
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
I think your name type is

374
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Jenny.

375
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Jenny?

376
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
The song's about him wanting to get with Jenny

377
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
and her sister to whose name is Deborah.

378
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
So it's not even really about me.

379
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
It's about the sister.

380
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
My sister's name is Mary.

381
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
She has got all the songs.

382
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
Mary, Mary, where are you going to?

383
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Proud Mary, keep on burning.

384
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
The wind cries, Mary.

385
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,860
She's got me beat again.

386
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
She's got endless songs.

387
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
I got one.

388
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
You got two.

389
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
That's the other one.

390
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Deborah, the song I'm talking about.

391
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,860
Who, by? Trex.

392
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
I've heard of them, but don't know that one.

393
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
How's it go?

394
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Oh, Deborah.

395
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Always look like a zebra.

396
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
A zebra?

397
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
A gazibra, I guess.

398
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
I'm working back and right, so you can call me D-B-R-A.

399
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,860
I think I actually got Deborah on here.

400
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,860
What? How many of those do you have?

401
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
I got different iPods for different days and moods.

402
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Oh, and you're in a...

403
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
pink and glittery mood.

404
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
I am now.

405
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
What is your name?

406
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Baby.

407
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
Wait, what? Your name's Baby.

408
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
B-A-B-Y Baby.

409
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
Yeah?

410
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,860
Then you have us all beat.

411
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Every damn song is about you.

412
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
We could drive back and forth across the states forever

413
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
and never run out of baby songs.

414
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
We might run out of cast.

415
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Did your mom call you Baby as a kid?

416
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Sometimes.

417
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
She used to work here?

418
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Sometimes, but, uh...

419
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,860
she was a singer, too.

420
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
What does she do now?

421
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
Nothing.

422
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Uh, I could find Deborah if she wanted.

423
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,860
Debbie!

424
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
Crying out loud.

425
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,860
I play it for me sometimes.

426
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
I don't have to get out of here.

427
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
Deal?

428
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Yeah, deal.

429
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
Now you know what you want yet?

430
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
To get out of here.

431
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
You're right.

432
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
I do like it.

433
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,860
So,

434
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
what's your story, Baby?

435
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
You from here?

436
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
I am.

437
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm from here.

438
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
I'm from here.

439
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
I'm from here.

440
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,860
I'm from here.

441
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,860
I'm from here.

442
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
I'm from here.

443
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I'm from here.

444
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
I'm from here.

445
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,860
I am.

446
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Keep going. Keep going.

447
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,860
You're from here.

448
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,860
You're a driver.

449
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
You like music.

450
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
You don't talk much.

451
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,860
No. I've, uh...

452
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
spoken more to you today

453
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
than I have to anyone all year.

454
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Whoa! Okay.

455
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Not a motormouth.

456
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
Noted.

457
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
I have this hearing thing.

459
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,860
I was in an accident when I was little.

460
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Is that what happened to your mom?

461
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,860
Yeah. Yeah, my dad.

462
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
I miss her.

463
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
I'm sorry.

464
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
No, don't be. I live with my foster dad,

465
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
but now he's getting old,

466
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,860
so it's more like I'm looking after him.

467
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Yeah, I know how that feels.

468
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,860
I have to look after my mom

469
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,860
when she got sick.

470
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
It might seem tough now,

471
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
but once they're gone,

472
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
therefore,

473
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
I don't have much to keep me here anymore.

474
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,860
You don't?

475
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,860
You know,

476
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,860
we could get together some other time.

477
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,860
Some other place.

478
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
Oh, you mean, uh,

479
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,860
somewhere that's not a diner or a laundromat?

480
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Yeah, well, it's not that this isn't nice, but...

481
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Well, we could go to, uh...

482
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
Um,

483
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,860
oh, Bacchanalia.

484
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
I've never been.

485
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
I hear it's nice.

486
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
Oh, it's the finest wine

487
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
in the dining of all the wines in Dyson Town.

488
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
That is nice.

489
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
Um, they got me pulling devils this week, though.

490
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,860
What about next week?

491
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
What's your schedule like?

492
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I don't know. Oh, I forgot.

493
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,860
They call you go.

494
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,860
No, I mean, I'm not working.

495
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
You're not driving anymore?

496
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,860
No. I'm sorry.

497
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
No, don't be. It's my choice.

498
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,860
Well, aren't you the lucky one?

499
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,860
You took that?

500
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,860
I saw these guys go marching

501
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
in the banquet hallway mass.

502
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Weapons strong.

503
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,860
They were tech.

504
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,860
Pizza?

505
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,860
Whoa.

506
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,860
That was that?

507
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
I know.

508
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Pizza!

509
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,860
Woo-hoo!

510
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,860
Hello.

511
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,860
You're all good,

512
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
a gentleman picked this up already.

513
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,860
A gentleman?

514
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,860
Who was it?

515
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,860
He was not on the show.

516
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,860
He's not on the show.

517
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,860
I don't know.

518
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,860
He's not on the show.

519
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,860
He's on the show.

520
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,860
He's on the show.

521
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,860
He's on the show.

522
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,860
You're all good.

523
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,860
You're all good.

524
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,860
A gentleman picked this up already.

525
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Who is that?

526
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,860
It's my old boss.

527
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,860
Uh...

528
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,860
Excuse me. One second.

529
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,860
Thank you, baby.

530
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,860
Have a good night.

531
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,860
Good meal, baby.

532
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,860
That foie gras terrain is something, huh?

533
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Yeah.

534
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,860
You don't look happy to see me. Why?

535
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,860
I said we were straight, but did you think we were done?

536
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,860
But that was it.

537
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,860
I'm sorry.

538
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,860
I'm sorry.

539
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,860
I guess I did.

540
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,860
Well, I could give you the good news and the bad news,

541
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,860
except there is no bad news.

542
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,860
The good news is you're about to make a lot of money.

543
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,860
And the good news is you're about to make a lot of money.

544
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,860
I got a job, Doc.

545
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Yeah.

546
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,860
The white slave away delivering good fella's pizzas

547
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
just to afford a night out here.

548
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
When you could make all that dough with a great fella,

549
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
me,

550
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,860
and then take your gal here for fucking dinner

551
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,860
every night of the week.

552
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
You paid all that money.

553
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,860
You've been doing dinner every night of the week.

554
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,860
You paid off your debt. Now it's time to profit.

555
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,860
This is the fun bit, baby.

556
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,860
By the time this job is over, you'll be rolling the money

557
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,860
by Maserati's and feeding your gal catfish dipped in gold.

558
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,860
So what do you say? Are you in?

559
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,860
Oh, yeah.

560
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,860
Am I in?

561
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,860
No, don't answer my question with another question.

562
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,860
You give me one or two replies, yes or no?

563
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,860
No, Doc.

564
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,860
You know I never do a job with the exact same crew twice, right?

565
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Yes.

566
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,860
And you also know you've been my driver for every job since we met.

567
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,860
Yes.

568
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,860
So I'm of the thinking

569
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,860
that you are my lucky charm

570
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,860
and that I'm not doing this job without you.

571
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,860
Now, I don't think I need to give you this feature

572
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,860
of what happens when you say no, how I can break your legs

573
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,860
and kill everyone you love, because you already know that, don't you?

574
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,860
Yeah.

575
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,860
So what's it gonna be?

576
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,860
A wheeler and a wheelchair.

577
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,860
The first one?

578
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,860
I'll pick you up in the morning.

579
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,860
Don't stay out too late now.

580
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Oh, and your, uh,

581
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,860
waitress girlfriend, she's cute.

582
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,860
Let's keep it that way.

583
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,860
Good night, sir.

584
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,860
Well,

585
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,860
there was some pretty fine wine in and dining.

586
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,860
I must have friends in high places to get a table there.

587
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,860
I don't know about that.

588
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,860
Is everything okay, baby?

589
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Yeah, it will be.

590
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,860
You wanna talk about it?

591
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,860
I'm making me a cup of coffee.

592
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,860
I mean, I don't.

593
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,860
I make terrible coffee.

594
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
I want to, but I...

595
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,860
I can't right now.

596
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,860
You know, Yuki,

597
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,860
you don't have to worry about me.

598
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,860
You can tell me anything.

599
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,860
I'm not worried about you.

600
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,860
I mean, I...

601
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,860
You're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.

602
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,860
And I just...

603
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,860
worry that...

604
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,860
I'm not good enough for you.

605
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,860
Well...

606
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,860
don't.

607
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,860
I can see you're kind in your...

608
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,860
desert.

609
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,860
Desert.

610
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,860
And I'm here for you when you're ready.

611
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,860
What do you know tomorrow?

612
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,860
Will you tell me?

613
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,860
I'll tell you tomorrow.

614
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,860
Morning.

615
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,860
These places never get rolled.

616
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,860
People don't realize that there's gold in them, their hills,

617
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,860
and those that do don't have the stones to pull off a job so public in the hub of it.

618
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,860
This place will be ripe around this time tomorrow,

619
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,860
but I need to do something for me today.

620
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,860
I can't be seen in there, but you can.

621
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,860
So go inside, take note of the number of cameras and positions,

622
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,860
the number of registers open,

623
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,860
the number of employees and the number of customers.

624
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,860
Because they're a guard, because he armed with a he banded glass.

625
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,860
And get in line by some stamps.

626
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,860
Take your buds out, pull your shades off.

627
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,860
I'll end up taking a few of us suspicious.

628
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,860
I'll be right back.

629
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,860
No banded glass, but I'm a guard.

630
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:50,860
Done cameras, eight registers to open all of our customers and full employees.

631
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,860
Thank you.

632
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,860
Uh, stamps?

633
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,860
Is that your boy?

634
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,860
Sure. Yeah, he sure is.

635
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,860
How old is he?

636
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,860
Four.

637
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,860
Eight.

638
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,860
They grow up so freaking fast, don't they?

639
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860
Does he have a name?

640
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,860
You have a name, don't you?

641
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,860
Sam.

642
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,860
Well, Sam, I got a mint with your name on it.

643
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,860
You have a mint that says Sam?

644
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,860
Oh, sweet.

645
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,860
Are you here tomorrow?

646
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,860
Sure am, working nine to five, just like Dolly.

647
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
Dolly Parton.

648
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,860
I like her.

649
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,860
Who doesn't? Everybody wants happiness, nobody wants pain.

650
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,860
But you can't have a rainbow without a little rain.

651
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,860
Why is Lady?

652
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,860
Yeah, she sure is.

653
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,860
Bye.

654
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,860
Hit me.

655
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,860
No banded glass, one armed guard.

656
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,860
Ten cameras, eight registers, three open.

657
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,860
And, uh, eleven customers.

658
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,860
Four employees.

659
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,860
Anything else?

660
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,860
The teller seemed nice.

661
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,860
She gave me a mint.

662
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,860
Did she?

663
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,860
Yeah, he probably wouldn't even need to use a gun with her.

664
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,860
Just say boo and she'll give you the big bills first.

665
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,860
Chips off the old block.

666
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,860
I'll show you.

667
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,860
What floor are you on?

668
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,860
Third.

669
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,860
Those stairs must be a real bitch for Joe, huh?

670
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,860
It's my business to know everything.

671
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,860
So, are they a bitch?

672
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,860
It's an elevator.

673
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,860
Ooh, fancy.

674
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,860
So,

675
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,860
are you gonna see tonight?

676
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,860
Yes, you will.

677
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,860
You're not just saying what you think I want to hear, right?

678
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,860
You consider me a friend, don't you?

679
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,860
You and I are a team.

680
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,860
Nothing's more important than our friendship.

681
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,860
Good to know.

682
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
You'll be out of this shit hole soon.

683
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,860
You're going up in the world.

684
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,860
Bo's Donner, what do you have?

685
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,860
Is Debra there?

686
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,860
Debbie, phone.

687
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,860
Keep it short.

688
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,860
Hi.

689
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,860
It's Baby.

690
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,860
Hey.

691
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,860
What do I owe this Donner?

692
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,860
I just wanted to hear your voice.

693
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,860
Am I still seeing you later?

694
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,860
I have to drive again.

695
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,860
Oh, okay.

696
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,860
I thought you all were done with that.

697
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,860
So did I.

698
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,860
Just know what I want.

699
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,860
And what do you want, Baby?

700
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,860
I want us to head west on 20.

701
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,860
In a car we can't afford.

702
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
With a plane we don't have.

703
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,860
Keep driving and never stop.

704
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,860
Are you serious?

705
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,860
I am Debra.

706
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,860
You in?

707
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,860
I'm in, Baby.

708
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,860
See you soon.

709
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,860
I'm in.

710
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,860
Holy Calamity!

711
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,860
Scream insanity!

712
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,860
You ever going to be another great fan of me?

713
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,860
Baby!

714
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,860
Baby!

715
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,860
There he is.

716
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,860
Hey, Baby.

717
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,860
You hear no evil's back, huh?

718
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
Have you seen this kid move?

719
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,860
Yeah, I think.

720
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,860
I think Doc likes having him around because he can park in a disabled spot.

721
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,860
Disabled spot?

722
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,860
Yeah, he got some shit wrong with his ears.

723
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,860
Tonight I saw something.

724
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,860
Anyway, he got to listen to music 24 hours a day to drown it in the wine and his ears.

725
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,860
Oh, shit!

726
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,860
You know who else has the exact same thing and does it exact same thing?

727
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,860
Barbra Streisand.

728
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,860
Do you look like I know a fucking thing about Barbara Streisand?

729
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,860
Hey, watch your mouth.

730
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,860
It's the lady you're talking to.

731
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,860
Yeah.

732
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,860
Watch your mouth.

733
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,860
I'll watch what I want to watch.

734
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,860
Is that true?

735
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,860
Do you have music in your head all the time?

736
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,860
Drown up the noise?

737
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,860
Yeah.

738
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,860
It keeps me moving.

739
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,860
It's an escape.

740
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,860
I get it.

741
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,860
Hey, buddy, you seen that violin?

742
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,860
I had a violin here.

743
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,860
Shut up!

744
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,860
I used to fool around with cars when I was a kid.

745
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,860
Grab around all night, look speed-freak, listen to the radio.

746
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,860
I used to have my special tape.

747
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,860
They had my special tape.

748
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,860
They had my killer track on it.

749
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,860
Get me flying.

750
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,860
You got one of those?

751
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,860
Sure.

752
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,860
What is it?

753
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,860
Riding Rock.

754
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,860
What? Queen?

755
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,860
Yeah, it's got that crazy big guitar solo.

756
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,860
That's how my brother used to play.

757
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,860
Sheer heart attack right through the wall.

758
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,860
You got it on here?

759
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,860
I got it on this one.

760
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,860
Play it.

761
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,860
Let's do that killer track.

762
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,860
Yeah.

763
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
What you ladies listening to?

764
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,860
Queen.

765
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,860
Strikes saying now, queen, the fuck, what y'all gonna do?

766
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,860
Y'all gonna belt out show tunes on the way to the job?

767
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,860
You don't need a score for a score.

768
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,860
You just boom, boom,

769
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,860
you're gonna put your foot on the gas

770
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,860
and drive a goddamn car.

771
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,860
That's all the music you need, folks.

772
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,860
Come on now.

773
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,860
You never been a wheel man?

774
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,860
You never had a lucky song?

775
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,860
Well, cigarette song, opera heist,

776
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,860
glass of scotch,

777
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,860
absolutely, but not before a job.

778
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,860
I got enough demons right here

779
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,860
playing music all the time.

780
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,860
Yeah, well, that I believe.

781
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,860
Had a buddy once walk away from a job.

782
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,860
You know why? Because something was playing

783
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,860
and we about to go in, he won't get out the fucking car.

784
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,860
Why?

785
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,860
Because knock knock knock on Heather's door,

786
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,860
he was playing on the FM.

787
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,860
Called it a heck song.

788
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,860
That ended the role by boys and men,

789
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,860
Hotel California by the Eagles.

790
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,860
He called them all heck songs.

791
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,860
Then come talking about some crazy shit like,

792
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,860
we all gonna die.

793
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,860
So what, you bail on the job?

794
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,860
Fuck no, I didn't bail on the job.

795
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,860
I wasn't got that money.

796
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,860
And we ain't die either.

797
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,860
Do all your stories end up with somebody dying?

798
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,860
Guess you just gotta fire down, huh?

799
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,860
I need four pairs of eyes

800
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,860
and three sets of ears, gather up.

801
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,860
The postal service is dying.

802
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,860
People don't care about their mail anymore.

803
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,860
Lucky for us.

804
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,860
Their loss is our gain.

805
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,860
Money orders.

806
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,860
For I happen to know a guy who has a machine

807
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,860
that can turn blank ones into green.

808
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,860
Each box contains 250 slips per box.

809
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,860
Each slip worth up to a grand,

810
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
that's quarter of a mil per box.

811
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,860
Dot dot dot, you do the math.

812
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,860
Darling goes in the front.

813
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,860
Buddy takes a five alligator count

814
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,860
and follows her inside.

815
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,860
You put on these privacy glasses.

816
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,860
Blind, the CCTV camera.

817
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,860
Another five alligator count.

818
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,860
Darling gets in line.

819
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,860
Buddy takes her hostage.

820
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,860
Shotgun to her head.

821
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,860
That gets you guys in the back office.

822
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,860
We real play that a lot.

823
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,860
Uh-huh.

824
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,860
Baby drives bats around the loading dock.

825
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,860
Bats uses this security card,

826
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,860
supplied by an insider with a nasal problem,

827
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,860
to get in the staff entrance and cover the rear.

828
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
You guys grab all the boxes

829
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,860
and get back to baby and the waiting car.

830
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,860
Did you get all that, baby?

831
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,860
Yeah.

832
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,860
Okay, one more thing.

833
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,860
We need some fresh hardware.

834
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,860
Not traceable to us or any previous jobs.

835
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,860
Now I've got some contacts that get us some clean firepower.

836
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,860
So the pickup is tonight.

837
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,860
But after the pickup, you come straight back here.

838
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,860
You all have an early start in the morning

839
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,860
and there's eyes everywhere.

840
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,860
So you're staying the night here.

841
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,860
We're gonna get together now.

842
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,860
MUSIC

843
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,860
Pull over there. I gotta take a leak.

844
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,860
Want some gum?

845
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,860
Want some gum, buddy?

846
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,860
Yeah, I'll take some gum.

847
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,860
Tell me what we're gonna do with all that money.

848
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,860
We're gonna go to Vegas.

849
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,860
We'll put it all on red.

850
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,860
We'll get married again.

851
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,860
And it'll be real romantic.

852
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,860
You know, it was real, real romantic.

853
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,860
It was real, real romantic.

854
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,860
We need to have that guy.

855
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,860
Which guy? The guy that robbed you?

856
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,860
The guy that called you a whore?

857
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
The guy that looked at you funny?

858
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,860
The last one.

859
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,860
Yeah, I do remember that.

860
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,860
Bats just looked at me funny.

861
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,860
You already killed bats?

862
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,860
Not before the job, silly.

863
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,860
Do you think we should talk about this in front of baby?

864
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,860
He won't say a thing.

865
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,860
Will you, baby?

866
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,860
Jesus Christ.

867
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,860
What did you steal all this?

868
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,860
Said you want some gum.

869
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,860
Fuck I'm supposed to do the pay for it.

870
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,860
Let's go.

871
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,860
Let's go.

872
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,860
Looks like the farmer's market is open.

873
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Farmer's market?

874
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,860
Yeah, Doc says we gotta go see the butcher.

875
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,860
Come on, you're going in with us.

876
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,860
We might not be leaving in this.

877
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,860
And, uh, find some funky on there.

878
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,860
Just in case we gotta rip this joint up.

879
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,860
Take this.

880
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,860
Act like you know how to use it.

881
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,860
Why would he need it?

882
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,860
We gotta swagger it like you got one.

883
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,860
So we don't all look like a bunch of pussy.

884
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,860
We're just gonna leave it.

885
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,860
We're gonna leave it.

886
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,860
We're gonna leave it.

887
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,860
What's with the earbuds?

888
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,860
Recordness or something?

889
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,860
It's just his music.

890
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,860
Yeah, he's loony. He's just like his tunes.

891
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,860
What's he listening to?

892
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,860
I got no.

893
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,860
Come on, let me check.

894
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,860
Tequila!

895
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,860
Which reminds me, why did Mexican do

896
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,860
throw his wife off the cliff?

897
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,860
Oh, you're still alive, right?

898
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,860
Uh-huh. Then I guess we ain't ever met.

899
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,860
Shut the fuck up!

900
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,860
I've got it.

901
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,860
I've got it.

902
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,860
Vuelas!

903
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,860
Welcome to La Chacaparri.

904
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,860
Tonight, gentlemen, madame,

905
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,860
we have only the finest cuts of pork

906
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,860
direct from the local smokehouse.

907
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
You're all experienced butchers yourself.

908
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,860
I assume you are aware that the humble pig

909
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,860
can be cooked from nose to tail,

910
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,860
everything but the squeal.

911
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,860
I can offer you nine cuts

912
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,860
at the best prices in all of Christendom.

913
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,860
So, let's dive in headfirst.

914
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,860
From the jowl comes the God-sent Roman bacon

915
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,860
that is Juan Chiale.

916
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,860
From the shoulder of the hog comes the

917
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,860
bosted but a tough but tasty cut.

918
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,860
The picnic shoulder is a favorite of those

919
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,860
who enjoy the smoking of pigs.

920
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,860
The center cut loin, the double cut pork chops,

921
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,860
baby back ribs, and the serrano ham.

922
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,860
On the back leg, of course.

923
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,860
All delicious.

924
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,860
And, of course, we have a fine selection of sausages.

925
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,860
Well, I'm hungry.

926
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,860
Fantastic.

927
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,860
And your choice is?

928
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,860
Well, I'm gonna go with the picnic shoulder

929
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,860
because I just love smoking pigs.

930
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,860
BAM!

931
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
Dundee.

932
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,860
Dumb son of a bitch.

933
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,860
Whoa!

934
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,860
Fuck, bats! You got my wife shot! I don't like that!

935
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,860
Relax, buddy. You handled it.

936
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,860
What the fuck, you piece of shit?

937
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,860
You shot the gun-tomans. Weren't they fucking Doc's contacts?

938
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,860
They were Doc's contacts.

939
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,860
Guess what? They were pigs. Look at the boxes. It's APD.

940
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,860
I clocked that tall stripper baker

941
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,860
with that fake-ass Louis Vuitton hat right off the bat.

942
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,860
He busted me in 98.

943
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,860
Now, I don't know about you love birds, fucking without a condom,

944
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,860
but when somebody gets ready to barbecue me,

945
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,860
I'm gonna fool them in the best shit I've ever seen.

946
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,860
Get him!

947
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,860
Baby, don't let him get away.

948
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,860
Get him!

949
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,860
Get us out of here, baby. Let's move.

950
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,860
Come on, let's go. Move.

951
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,860
Takeda.

952
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,860
Not that easy.

953
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,860
Whoo!

954
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,860
Bats are fucking crazy.

955
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,860
When you folks name your bats, you're gonna end up crazy.

956
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,860
I don't doubt you're crazy, but your real name is not bats.

957
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,860
So says you.

958
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,860
You think my real name's Darling?

959
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,860
Yeah, or Buddy? No, they're nicknames.

960
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,860
Codenames, monikers.

961
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,860
So what's your real name, Darling?

962
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,860
Monica.

963
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,860
I thought we were allowed to discuss names.

964
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,860
We're not.

965
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,860
Baby, what's your real name?

966
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,860
Huh?

967
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,860
Hey, stop, stop, stop up here.

968
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,860
Stop up here.

969
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,860
So stop, I'm hungry.

970
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,860
No.

971
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,860
Stop the car!

972
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,860
No? You telling me no?

973
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,860
I don't want to go in there.

974
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,860
I don't want to go in.

975
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,860
Well, hello, baby.

976
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,860
Buddy's at the floor back there, and you don't say shit.

977
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,860
Now all of a sudden, you getting...

978
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,860
you getting riled up about stopping at a dime?

979
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,860
I don't want to go in there. It sucks.

980
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,860
What about that recommendation?

981
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,860
We gots to go in there.

982
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:53,860
When something is wrong with my baby

983
01:06:53,860 --> 01:07:02,860
Something's wrong with me

984
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,860
Now why else, old man?

985
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,860
You should be thinking old bads.

986
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,860
For being a walking fucking death wish.

987
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,860
You're gonna not treat all of my jobs like it's my last.

988
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,860
But what you do within this group affects all of us.

989
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,860
So don't care, boy. You're gonna get your money tomorrow.

990
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,860
Plus, uh, you guys got noses to feed.

991
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,860
Well, yeah, like you're Mr. Clean.

992
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,860
Mr. What-up-a-fuck-a-wombie.

993
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,860
Can I get you anything to drink?

994
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,860
Uh, yeah, I think it'd be a coke all around, right?

995
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,860
How you saying in your language? Coke-a?

996
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,860
So let me get three cokes and one...

997
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,860
Coca.

998
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,860
Four cokes?

999
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,860
Yeah.

1000
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,860
Look here's the deal.

1001
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,860
You robbed to support a drug habit.

1002
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,860
I do drugs to support a robbery habit.

1003
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,860
That's clever.

1004
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,860
That's my job, see.

1005
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,860
It's you two's on that case.

1006
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,860
So you doubt our credentials?

1007
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,860
Wall Street, right?

1008
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:50,860
Doctor, I ain't done.

1009
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,860
Don't you tell me shit?

1010
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,860
Just an educated guess.

1011
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,860
For my uneducated man.

1012
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,860
Well, that's-I don't be fascinated to hear your thoughts on the matter.

1013
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,860
Tell me from way off, buddy.

1014
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,860
You were a star broker.

1015
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,860
Maybe a different wife, maybe kids.

1016
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,860
You stack your paper, but you say shit like,

1017
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,860
work hard, play hard, or but you play a little too hard.

1018
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,860
You rack up debt.

1019
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,860
The type of debt that'll make a white man blush.

1020
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,860
Maybe you get into a little trouble.

1021
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,860
Maybe you get your hand caught in a corporate cookie jar.

1022
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,860
Maybe you leave and run off to the desert.

1023
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,860
Maybe with your favorite lap dancer in tow.

1024
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,860
Maybe you disappear into a world consistent to three things.

1025
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:27,860
Money, sex, drugs, and action.

1026
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:31,860
Oh shit, that's full.

1027
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,860
Am I close?

1028
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,860
This is how I look at it.

1029
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,860
You guys just think this is a trip.

1030
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,860
Either way, if you are Wall Street,

1031
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,860
you're a bigger fucking crook than I could ever be.

1032
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,860
I'm gonna go right ahead and speak for the two of us.

1033
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,860
I'm gonna go right ahead and speak for the two of us.

1034
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,860
I think you know us.

1035
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,860
You don't.

1036
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,860
You think you're the last word in crazy.

1037
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,860
You're not.

1038
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,860
And believe me, when I tell you,

1039
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,860
you don't want to see my buddy mad.

1040
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,860
You haven't seen how relentless he is.

1041
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,860
Because when he sees red,

1042
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,860
you will see nothing but black.

1043
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,860
You hear that speed?

1044
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,860
That's some Oscar shit right there.

1045
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,860
That was nice. You rehearsed that?

1046
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:28,860
You see the shit, baby?

1047
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,860
See that? This is a prime example of a man

1048
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:34,860
who loves a woman.

1049
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,860
You guys perfectly do.

1050
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:39,860
I mean that.

1051
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,860
What can I get you to eat?

1052
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,860
Get these cats some half of meals and I won't take care of them.

1053
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,860
I won't take care of them.

1054
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,860
Uh, Deborah.

1055
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,860
My friend here, he doesn't like this place.

1056
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,860
But I think he's telling us.

1057
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,860
So let me ask you something, Deborah.

1058
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,860
What's his problem?

1059
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,860
And maybe your friend would like to fill out a suggestion slip.

1060
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,860
Tell us how to improve our service.

1061
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,860
Baby, you know that bitch?

1062
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,860
No.

1063
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,860
Okay.

1064
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,860
That's bad.

1065
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,860
I got this.

1066
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,860
Let's put the fuck up your problem.

1067
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,860
Hey.

1068
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,860
Okay.

1069
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,860
Okay.

1070
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,860
I'll make sure you tip the knife, lady.

1071
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:23,860
If you will stay with me.

1072
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,860
Yes.

1073
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,860
Every little bit first.

1074
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,860
Every little bit first.

1075
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,860
Bananas.

1076
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,860
Bananas is a code word.

1077
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,860
Whenever a deal is done with one of my clients,

1078
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,860
they call me on the phone and they say the word bananas

1079
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,860
and then they hang up.

1080
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:50,860
I did not hear the word bananas tonight.

1081
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,860
So you tell me who died.

1082
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:56,860
Well, you're not going to tell me who died.

1083
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,860
I'm not going to tell you who died.

1084
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,860
I'm not going to tell you who died.

1085
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,860
So you tell me who died.

1086
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,860
Well, your contacts was cops, Doc.

1087
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,860
I know.

1088
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,860
They were my cops.

1089
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,860
Yeah, well, they fired first.

1090
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,860
And I'm not going to take a bullet for you

1091
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,860
and nobody else in this motherfucker.

1092
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,860
Is that true? They fired first?

1093
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,860
Yep.

1094
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:30,860
Baby?

1095
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,860
I have somebody on the planet Earth.

1096
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,860
I will ask whoever the fuck I want.

1097
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,860
Go home, jobs off.

1098
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

1099
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,860
We are 24 hours from being descended upon by this entire city.

1100
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,860
Those pigs are in hog heaven.

1101
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,860
The only way they can ID us is with a Ouija board or some shit.

1102
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,860
Well, your name only takes four letters to spell out.

1103
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,860
But that bad thing my real fucking name.

1104
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,860
It's over, Leon.

1105
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,860
Get out of town.

1106
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:02,860
Well, well, I ain't running, Doc.

1107
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,860
I said we'd drive into the storm.

1108
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,860
Ride the hurricane.

1109
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,860
We could be on a non-extradition beach,

1110
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,860
drinking non-extradition cocktails,

1111
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,860
counting our non-extradition cash in 23 hours.

1112
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,860
And who do we get to fence those money orders

1113
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,860
since you shot the fence?

1114
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,860
Buddy got a guy.

1115
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,860
I mean, I'm just taking a wild guess here,

1116
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,860
but Buddy got a guy, ain't that right, Wall Street?

1117
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,860
Yeah, I got a guy.

1118
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,860
So let's fucking do this.

1119
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,860
I only hear three voices,

1120
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,860
and the last time I checked there's four in a car.

1121
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,860
Baby, your call.

1122
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,860
Time to make a big boy decision.

1123
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,860
Did we do this thing or not?

1124
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,860
He's out voting. We're doing it.

1125
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,860
I said we all get some sleep.

1126
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:47,860
Get ready for this fucking thing.

1127
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,860
Baby, your call.

1128
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,860
Time to make a big boy decision.

1129
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,860
Do we do this thing or not?

1130
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,860
Do we do this thing or not?

1131
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,860
Do we do this thing or not?

1132
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,860
Do we do this thing or not?

1133
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,860
Do we do this thing or not?

1134
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,860
I

1135
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,020
Ready going baby

1136
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,380
Coffee

1137
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,660
That's two a.m.

1138
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,780
That doesn't sound smart

1139
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,940
You fucking kidding me. I got enough of my plate worried about bats. I got to worry about you too now

1140
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,620
You know what do me a favor if you're gonna mail it in at the post office tomorrow

1141
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,260
Then go on your little caffeine run

1142
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,420
And they'll come back

1143
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:57,900
If you're just in this for the buzz if driving is just some kind of escape for you then go

1144
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,020
Child doing it

1145
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,860
Just making sure everything's ready for tomorrow

1146
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,300
We're like he's going somewhere two o'clock in the morning

1147
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,980
I know

1148
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,980
Good

1149
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,220
Cuz we gotta discuss this

1150
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,620
No, no, it's the same one

1151
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:32,500
Baby your call time to make a big boy decision. Yeah, we did this thing or not. No, you want to go and do that

1152
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,500
It's just me fooling around. I like to record stuff

1153
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,620
Why you like to course though?

1154
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,300
You the police

1155
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,980
Supposed to grill on the road not the cops speak up, baby

1156
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:52,120
I like to listen back to conversations. I think music out of the words song mixes just something I do

1157
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,020
That's one fucking dumbass excuse

1158
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:59,980
Be fair even the cops couldn't come up with an excuse said fucking dumbass now

1159
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,380
Can you play us one of your mixes? I can't

1160
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,860
They're home. Well, it's like we all go somewhere to clock in one

1161
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,420
Come on

1162
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,460
I'll live really far away

1163
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,460
No, you don't

1164
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,820
Wake up, baby time to explain

1165
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:32,500
Joe what are you doing the cripple? Oh, don't worry about him

1166
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,060
He's good

1167
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,460
Ain't gonna

1168
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,460
Watch play or something, baby

1169
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,100
This is

1170
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,260
Deborah isn't that the waitress from the diner

1171
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,260
You say you didn't know that bitch

1172
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:41,260
Why would you say you didn't know her? Have you been talking to Deborah about us? I don't say nothing about wheels

1173
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,780
He can't say nothing. Yeah, but he can read motherfucking lips. Okay?

1174
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:50,820
Take this fool back to his shithole. I'll find another driver for tomorrow. Doc. I'm a baby

1175
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:56,980
Well, I can take more needs to go get him home safe. No, you're not getting a new driver. I've been on every job since we met I

1176
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:01,820
Don't go to the cops. I screw on the road. Now. I'm not slow. I'm fast

1177
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,260
I'm your driver tomorrow. I'm driving

1178
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:14,260
Well, you heard the kid he's driving

1179
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:28,980
This afternoon

1180
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,180
Chance's got her thunderstorms throughout most of the day low tonight about point

1181
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,460
Remember what's in there is ours belongs to us

1182
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:52,020
They got our money they got our mama's jewels

1183
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:58,100
So let's go back in there and take back what's ours

1184
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,020
I

1185
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:37,460
Boom boom boom. It's go time, baby. How the fuck I look

1186
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,020

01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,900
Put your fucking foot on the gas

1190
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:54,020
Oh

1191
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,780
What did you do, baby?

1192
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,900
What the fuck did you do? I moved

1193
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,020
Oh

1194
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:54,020
Oh

1195
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,020
Oh

1196
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,020
Oh

1197
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,020

Oh

01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,020
Your fault

1202
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:26,020
I

1203
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:30,960
Egor flashing KIM

01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,420
You know what I'm saying?

1207
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,280
Get out of the car lady!

1208
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:53,800
You get it!

1209
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,320
Get out of here!

1210
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,320

I got the ball!

1215
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,840
He's on, man.

1216
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
What the fuck?

1217
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:59,840
The police tell us that three robbers entered a US post office branch downtown shortly after 1 p.m.

1218
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,840
But what started after the robbery?

1219
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
Shit, Joe! Joe, Joe, Joe!

1220
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,840
You alright? I'm so sorry, this is all my fault.

1221
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,840
We gotta get out of here, alright? Thanks for back.

1222
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,840
I know, I know, but I can't leave you here.

1223
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,840
Bo's daughter, what do you have?

1224
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,840
Is Debra there?

1225
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,840
Debbie? She's with a customer right now, you want a hold?

1226
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,840
Just tell her baby's coming.

1227
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,840
Baby?

1228
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,840
V-A-B-Y, baby.

1229
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:58,840
We've got a look out for 1986 Purple, Chevy Caprice, and we're about to release Mellon's on the news.

1230
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,840
Four policemen who have entered a downtown shootout

1231
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,840
after police say they're in the police post and they're still at large are considered extremely dangerous.

1232
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
Hello.

1233
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,840
My name is Joseph.

1234
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,840
I like TV.

1235
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:24,840
And I also like to listen sometimes to old records through the vibrations.

1236
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:32,840
I like frozen peas and meatloaf and white bread and peanut butter.

1237
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
Spread to the edge.

1238
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
Please look after me. Thank you.

1239
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,840
Please look after me.

1240
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,840
Please look after me. Thank you.

1241
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:59,840
This is the Atlanta Police Department. All residents remain inside your homes.

1242
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:06,840
This is the Atlanta Police Department. All residents remain inside your homes.

1243
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:13,840
There is an armed and dangerous criminal on the loose. Do not go outside until all players get to the police.

1244
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
Hello.

1245
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
Hello.

1246
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,840
Your buddy's here.

1247
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,840
Good luck, Bertz. I was hoping I would catch you too.

1248
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,840
And here you are.

1249
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,840
Monica Castello.

1250
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
Monica.

1251
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,840
My darling.

1252
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,840
She was a good girl.

1253
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,840
I love...

1254
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
I loved her.

1255
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,840
What about Deborah, baby? Is she...

1256
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,840
Is she a good girl? You love her?

1257
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
Yes, I do.

1258
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
That's too bad.

1259
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,840
I love you.

1260
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,840
This is the bathroom key.

1261
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
Thanks.

1262
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
Thanks.

1263
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,840
That's plenty.

1264
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
Thank you.

1265
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
I'm never gonna quit.

1266
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,840
With just being my stick.

1267
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,840
I'm gonna stay right here with you.

1268
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,840
As long as you're with her, baby.

1269
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,840
I'm afraid you still have the face to music.

1270
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,840
How are you two doing tonight?

1271
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,840
We're doing just fine.

1272
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,840
Ain't that right, baby?

1273
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,840
Come on, come on.

1274
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,840
You can't keep running, baby.

1275
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
There's no escape.

1276
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
Fuck, let's get out of here.

1277
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,840
Fuck.

1278
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
What's happening, baby?

1279
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,840
I have to go.

1280
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,840
No. I'm coming with you.

1281
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,840
You just shot a guy.

1282
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,840
Who? Him.

1283
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,840
Atlanta Police Department. You on the ground.

1284
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,840
Are you okay? Can you show me where you've been shot?

1285
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,840
Yeah.

1286
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,840
Right there.

1287
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,840
Officer down.

1288
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,840
Shot fired. I repeat, shot fired and boosed down here.

1289
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,840
Unit 412, Carly on scene, requested backup.

1290
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,840
Possible female hostage.

1291
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:34,840
Who's this?

1292
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:35,840
It's Baby.

1293
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
Like I said, who's this?

1294
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,840
I need your help.

1295
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,840
I'm afraid this line is dead.

1296
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,840
Baby, we need to get out of here.

1297
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
I just need one thing first.

1298
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,840
And then it's just us, music, and the road.

1299
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,840
But we don't have a car or music.

1300
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,840
Yeah, we do.

1301
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:03,840
Get out.

1302
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,840
Check out Bonnie and Clyde, yo.

1303
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,840
Bonnie and Bonnie.

1304
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,840
Get out of the car.

1305
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,840
You hold him.

1306
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,840
You ever shot a gun before, huh?

1307
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,840
I just did.

1308
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,840
Literally five minutes ago.

1309
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,840
Can we just get my goddamn phone?

1310
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,840
No.

1311
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,840
I'm not making it.

1312
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,840
Not a chauffeur.

1313
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,840
Noted.

1314
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,840
It's over, kid. I ain't open.

1315
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,840
I need those tapes.

1316
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,840
I'm not giving you those tapes.

1317
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,840
I have the money orders. I'll trade you for one of those tapes.

1318
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,840
I can't help you, Baby.

1319
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,840
I shot, buddy.

1320
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,840
Congratulations.

1321
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,840
Then you only have every clean and dirty cop after you.

1322
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,840
You gonna shoot me, too?

1323
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,840
Never. You and I are a team.

1324
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
Don't feed me any more lines or monsters.

1325
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,840
Ink. It pisses me off.

1326
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,840
It's one of Sam's favorites.

1327
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,840
I thought it sounded familiar, you little shit.

1328
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,840
I'm not your lucky charm anymore.

1329
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,840
But I'm standing here asking for your help.

1330
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,840
There's nothing I can do for you, kid.

1331
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,840
Why should I after what you've done to me?

1332
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,840
It's okay. Let's go.

1333
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,840
Oh, god damn it.

1334
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,840
Look at the two of you.

1335
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
Okay. Go get your fucking tape.

1336
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,840
It's going to take more than a cassette to get you two out of this.

1337
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,840
Because the news is all bad.

1338
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,840
Well, there is some good news.

1339
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,840
The good news is you're like driving.

1340
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,840
Because you can't take your foot off the gas for the next 20 minutes.

1341
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
Then you'll be fine.

1342
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,840
But the only good news is that you can't take your foot off the gas.

1343
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,840
I'm sorry.

1344
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,840
I'm sorry.

1345
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,840
I'm sorry.

1346
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,840
I'm sorry.

1347
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,840
I'm sorry.

1348
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
But then you're like a fucking idiot.

1349
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
You're such a fucking idiot.

1350
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,840
You're just a fucking idiot.

1351
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,840
Because you can't take your foot off the gas for the next 25 years.

1352
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:50,140
This should be enough to get you across the border.

1353
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:51,640
From there, it's on you.

1354
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:53,640
Don't trust anyone but each other.

1355
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,940
And don't ever look back.

1356
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,040
I was in love once.

1357
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,140
Banana!

1358
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:06,840
Run!

1359
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,340
I thought...

1360
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:22,340
I thought I told you to run.

1361
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:27,840
Go.

1362
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:29,840
I'll deal with the cops.

1363
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,840
That's not the cops.

1364
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,840
Here is the baby.

1365
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,840
Your killer track.

1366
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1367
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1368
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1369
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,840
Oh, fuck.

1370
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:14,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1371
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,840
Back! Get the back!

1372
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1373
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:15,840
Fuck!

1374
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,840
We're getting out.

1375
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,840
We're getting out?

1376
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,840
I have to end this.

1377
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,840
Come on out now, baby!

1378
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,840
Romeo, Romeo!

1379
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840
Where for, are you?

1380
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:49,840
No!

1381
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,840
Motherfucker!

1382
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,840
The email is out for SWAT car 3204.

1383
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,840
It needs to be stolen by a Jason of Van Horn.

1384
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:07,840
Show yourself, Fire Nation!

1385
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,840
You fucking trials!

1386
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,840
Hey, you okay, buddy?

1387
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,840
Your arm and extreme knee-bathing.

1388
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:16,840
Fuck!

1389
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:17,840
Jesus!

1390
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:18,840
Shatty!

1391
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:19,840
Assistance!

1392
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,840
Fuck you, buddy!

1393
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,840
Shit, shit, shit!

1394
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,840
You did good, kid.

1395
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,840
But you took something away from me that I loved.

1396
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,840
You know I gotta do the same.

1397
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:22,840
No!

1398
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,840
I really wish you could hear a scream.

1399
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1400
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1401
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1402
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1403
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
I really wish you could hear a scream.

1404
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,840
Guess you just have to watch.

1405
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1406
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,840
What are you doing?

1407
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,840
Getting the road.

1408
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,840
Wiping in the music.

1409
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:46,840
Is this really your mom?

1410
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:51,840
Yeah.

1411
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,840
She has a beautiful voice.

1412
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,840
I know.

1413
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
It's one reason

1414
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,840
that I'm not going to let you go.

1415
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,840
It's why I'm easy

1416
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,840
I need you like Sunday morning.

1417
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,840
It's why I'm easy

1418
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:33,840
I need you like Sunday morning.

1419
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,840
Why am I worried about everybody?

1420
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:42,840
The chains on the breeze.

1421
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:44,840
They're too big.

1422
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,840
Hold on a minute.

1423
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,840
They'll be my duty to make it.

1424
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1425
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:56,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1426
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,840
I'm not going to let you go.

1427
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,840
I'm not happy when I try to fake it.

1428
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
I'm not happy when I try to fake it.

1429
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:19,840
You don't belong in this world.

1430
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,840
I want to be free.

1431
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,840
I want to be free.

1432
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,840
I want to be free.

1433
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:41,840
I want to be free.

1434
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:43,840
I want to be free.

1435
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,840
I want to be free.

1436
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,840
I want to be free.

1437
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:49,840
I want to be free.

1438
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,840
I want to be free.

1439
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,840
I want to be free.

1440
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,840
I want to be free.

1441
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:57,840
I want to be free.

1442
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,840
I want to be free.

1443
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:01,840
I want to be free.

1444
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:02,840
I want to be free.

1445
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:06,840
I want to be free.

1446
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,840
I want to be free.

1447
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:10,840
I want to be free.

1448
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,840
How would you describe your relationship with the defendant?

1449
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:18,840
We were friends.

1450
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,840
And I think we both wanted to be more than that.

1451
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,840
He got himself into a bad spot.

1452
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,840
I was just trying to get him out.

1453
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,840
I believe the defendant is of good character.

1454
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,840
He didn't deserve what happened to him.

1455
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,840
It was the strangest thing.

1456
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
He finally drove off.

1457
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,840
And he threw my purse right at me.

1458
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,840
And he actually said I'm sorry.

1459
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,840
He looked at me and he shook his head.

1460
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,840
Like he was warning me, somehow telling me not to go inside.

1461
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:51,840
He looked concerned like he was trying to save me.

1462
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,840
He made a mistake when he was younger.

1463
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,840
And it's haunted him ever since.

1464
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,840
When he tried to get out, he was pressured even harder.

1465
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,840
It was never his fault.

1466
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:05,840
He's got a good heart.

1467
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,840
Always had.

1468
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:09,840
Always will.

1469
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,840
With regard to counts one through nineteen and count twenty one.

1470
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,840
I hear by sentence the defendant to twenty five years in the federal penitentiary.

1471
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,840
Subject to a parole hearing after five years served.

1472
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,840
You got a letter kid.

1473
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,840
Hey baby.

1474
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,840
You know it's funny.

1475
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,840
Even though I heard it so many times in the court case.

1476
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:48,840
I still can't get used to the fact that your real name is Miles.

1477
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:50,840
It's a cool name though.

1478
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,840
I can think of a lot of great milestones.

1479
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
But we still have to get through all those things.

1480
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,840
I can't wait until the day when it's just us.

1481
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,840
Music.

1482
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,840
And the road.

1483
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:05,840
See you later baby.

1484
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:07,840
All my love.

1485
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:09,840
Deborah.

1486
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,840
Music.

1487
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,840
Music.

1488
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,840
Music.

1489
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,840
Music.

1490
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,840
Music.

1491
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,840
Music.

1492
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,840
Music.

1493
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,840
Music.

1494
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,200
No, no, no, no.

1495
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,200
Good, good, good.

1496
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,000
Yeah, the devil behind the wheel.

1497
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,600
Was he slow?

1498
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,520
Richard, it means slow.

1499
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,800
Was he slow?

1500
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,800
No, no, no, no.

1501
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,800
What the hell, last morning?

1502
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,080
You know, devil, devil, devil behind the wheel.

1503
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,560
Richard, it means slow.

1504
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,040
Was he slow?

1505
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,040
No, no, no.

1506
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,920
The devil behind the wheel.

1507
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,520
Was he slow?

1508
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,520
No, no, no, no.

1509
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,520
No, no, no.

1510
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,120
Was he slow?

1511
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,360
No.

1512
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:55,440
時,時, is it good?

1513
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:56,440
Is it good?

1514
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:57,440
Yeah, is it good?

1515
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,920
The devil behind the wheel.

1516
01:51:58,920 --> 01:51:59,920
Was he slow?

1517
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,920
No.

1518
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,920
No, you don't sound retarded to me.

1519
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,840
Is it good kid and devil behind the wheel.

1520
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:07,840
What the hell, last morning?

1521
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:15,840
You know, was he slow?

1522
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,840
The devil behind the wheel.

1523
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,840
Was he slow?

1524
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:24,160
Was he slow?

1525
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:28,160
Was he slow?

1526
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,840
Was he slow?

1527
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,840
Was he slow?
